## :rocket: Getting Started :

Make sure you already installed DirectX 9 SDK and the environment variable "DXSDK_DIR" is set, if you don't know how to do this go [**here**](https://github.com/adamhlt/D3D9-Hook-ImGui#rocket-getting-started).

If it's not the case download DirectX 9 SDK [**here**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812).

### Visual Studio :

1. Open the solution file (.sln).
2. Build the project in Realese (x86)

Every configuration in x86 (Debug and Realese) are already configured with librairies and includes.

> **Warning**
> You cannot compile this project in x64 because the game is a x86 executable.

### Other IDE using CMAKE :

This **CMakeLists.txt** should compile the project.

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)
project(WAW)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
include_directories(Detours/include $ENV{DXSDK_DIR}Include)
link_directories(Detours/x86 $ENV{DXSDK_DIR}Lib/x86/)
file(GLOB ImGui ImGui/*.cpp ImGui/*.h)

add_library(WAW SHARED framework.h pch.h dllmain.cpp Hook.h Hook.cpp Drawing.h Drawing.cpp Core.h Core.cpp Utils.h Utils.cpp ${ImGui})
target_link_libraries(WAW detours.lib d3d9.lib d3dx9.lib)
```

Tested on CLion with MSVC compiler, you can get Visual Studio Build Tools [**here**](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/downloads/?q=build+tools).
